# ParetoFrontMovie
Code to create a movie of the Pareto Front in R for up to six objectives. The objectives are three spatial dimensions, size, color, and transparency. The input file is assumed to be the Pareto front at different stages of the optimization, where the stages are separated by a given character. Several R libraries must be installed, see the initial lines of code for the full list.
